permute reads lines from a file or standard input and generates all
permutations to a specified depth. For example,

	# echo -e "hello\nworld" ./permute 2
	
generates

	hello
	hellohello
	helloworld
	world
	worldhello
	worldworld

WHY ON EARTH DO I NEED THIS?

  I needed to generate permutations of some data sets I had, so I wrote it.
  Perhaps you also feel like permuting stuff in your spare time?
  Grow fascinated by the endless combinations possible!
